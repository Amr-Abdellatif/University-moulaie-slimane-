      "\n",

For example, in Context 1, \"but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion . EOS pad The Law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion .\" suggests that the law (EOS pad) requires attention to be applied. Similarly, in Context 2, \"by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions.\" implies that self-attention is necessary for achieving desired results.\n",

      "Final Answer: ## Step 1: Identify the key differences between deep learning and traditional machine learning.\n",
      "The key differences between deep learning and traditional machine learning are their approach to handling complex data, the complexity of an approach, and the modeling capabilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 2: Determine the relevance of each point in understanding the difference between deep learning and traditional machine learning.\n",
      "Traditional machine learning relies on simpler algorithms and models that focus on making predictions or classifications without explicitly learning a pattern through experience. In contrast, deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns in data.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 3: Explain how these key points relate to each other.\n",
      "The simplicity or complexity of an approach is reflected in the number of layers and interconnected nodes used in the model. The ability of a machine learning approach to handle complex data is also related to its modeling capabilities, as more complex models are better suited for handling high-dimensional data.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 4: Identify any patterns or connections that can be identified in this information.\n",
      "The relationship between simplicity and complexity, and the relationship between modeling capabilities and the need for multiple layers, illustrate key concepts in machine learning. Additionally, the distinction between deep learning and traditional machine learning highlights their differences in approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 5: Develop a logical flow to present this information effectively.\n",
      "The logical flow should start with an introduction to traditional machine learning, followed by an explanation of its limitations (simple algorithms, lack of explicit pattern recognition). Then, introduce deep learning as an alternative that can handle complex data. Finally, explain how the complexity and modeling capabilities of deep learning models are different from those of traditional models.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 6: Write a clear and concise final answer.\n",
      "Traditional machine learning is limited to simple algorithms that do not explicitly learn patterns from data. In contrast, deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns in data. The complexity of these approaches is reflected in the number of layers and interconnected nodes used.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Step 7: Provide a well-structured final answer.\n",
      "Traditional machine learning relies on simpler algorithms that focus on making predictions or classifications without explicitly learning a pattern through experience. Deep learning, on the other hand, uses neural networks with multiple layers to model complex patterns in data, which is more suitable for handling high-dimensional data.\n",
      "\n",
      "The final answer is: $\\boxed{Traditional machine learning relies on simpler algorithms and does not explicitly learn patterns from data, whereas deep learning models handle complex data using neural networks with multiple layers.}$\n"
